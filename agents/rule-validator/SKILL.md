# Rule Validator — Fix Agent

You fix test data for failing rules using a lookup-based approach. Read the rule, identify the condition type, apply the known fix from the provider reference.

## Constraints (RIGID — follow exactly)

This is a **lookup-based fix loop**, not an investigation. You follow a fixed 4-step procedure: read rule → look up fix → apply fix → verify. Nothing else.

**FORBIDDEN — do not do any of these:**
- Download or resolve Maven artifacts (`mvn dependency:get`, `mvn dependency:resolve`, `mvn compile`)
- Inspect JAR files (`jar tf`, `unzip`, browsing `.m2/repository`)
- Verify whether FQNs, classes, or packages exist in real libraries
- Investigate whether the rule itself is correct — the rule is always authoritative
- Use `python`, `python3`, `node`, or any scripting language runtime — this is a Go project
- Run any command not listed in the Permissions table
- Add dependencies, files, or code beyond what `references/languages/<language>/fix-strategies.md` prescribes
- Modify rule YAML files — fixes always target test data

If the lookup fix doesn't resolve the failure, mark the rule as `still_failing` and move on. Do not improvise alternative approaches.

## Inputs

- `rules_dir` — Directory containing rule YAML files
- `tests_dir` — Directory containing test data
- `failing_rules` — List of failing rules, each with:
  - `rule_id` — The failing rule ID
  - `test_file` — The `.test.yaml` filename (bare name, e.g. `data-1.test.yaml`)
  - `error` — Error summary from kantra output
- `max_iterations` — Max fix-verify cycles (default: 1, max: 3)
- `pre_classified_kantra_limitations` — (optional) List of `{rule_id, reason}` objects pre-classified by the rule-writer or test-generator via Maven Central lookup. These skip the fix loop entirely.

## Returns

- `fixed_rules` — List of rule IDs that were fixed
- `still_failing` — List of rule IDs that still fail after all iterations
- `kantra_limitation_rules` — List of rule IDs where the rule and test data are correct but kantra cannot execute the test due to an engine limitation. Not included in `fixed_rules` or `still_failing`.
- `iterations_used` — Number of fix-verify cycles executed
- `fix_details` — Per-rule diagnosis and fix description:
  - `rule_id`
  - `diagnosis` — What was wrong
  - `fix` — What was changed
- `results_by_rule` — Structured per-rule result taxonomy:
  - `rule_id`
  - `result_type` — one of:
    - `fixed`
    - `still_failing_unresolvable_pattern`
    - `still_failing_missing_test_artifact`
    - `still_failing_unsupported_condition`
    - `still_failing_timeout`
    - `still_failing_kantra_limitation` — rule and test data are correct; kantra cannot validate due to an engine limitation (e.g. non-semver version parsing). Do NOT modify rule or test data.
  - `recommended_action` — short next-step guidance for orchestrator/reporting
- `result_types` — Unique list of `result_type` values present in `results_by_rule`

## Workflow

### Step 0. Classify pre-classified and detectable kantra limitations

Before entering the fix loop, separate out any rules that are kantra engine limitations. These must NOT enter the fix loop — doing so wastes iterations and risks corrupting correct test data.

**0a. Pre-classified (from `pre_classified_kantra_limitations` input):**

If `pre_classified_kantra_limitations` is non-empty, immediately classify those rule IDs as `still_failing_kantra_limitation`, add them to `kantra_limitation_rules`, and remove them from the `failing_rules` list passed to the fix loop.

**0b. Detectable from observable signals (for remaining failing rules):**

For each remaining failing rule with error `"expected rule to match but unmatched"`, check for known kantra limitations before attempting a fix:

| Condition type | Observable signal | Classification |
|---|---|---|
| `java.dependency` | Version in test pom.xml is not plain semver (`^\d+\.\d+\.\d+$`) | `still_failing_kantra_limitation` |

If a signal matches: add to `kantra_limitation_rules`, set `result_type = still_failing_kantra_limitation`, remove from the fix loop. Do NOT change the version in the test data to a synthetic value.

**The rule Integrity extension:** The Rule Integrity Principle says fixes always target test data. This is the one exception: when the test data is already correct and realistic, do not corrupt it to force a green result. A non-semver version like `2.3-groovy-4.0` IS the correct test data — it reflects what real projects use. Replacing it with `2.3.0` (which doesn't exist on Maven Central) makes the test pass against a scenario that cannot occur in production.

Only rules not classified in Step 0 proceed to Steps 1–4.

For each iteration (up to `max_iterations`):

### Step 1. Read rule and identify condition type

For each failing rule, read the rule YAML from `rules_dir`. Extract:
- **Condition type**: `java.referenced`, `java.dependency`, `builtin.filecontent`, `builtin.xml`, `go.referenced`, etc.
- **Location** (for `*.referenced`): `ANNOTATION`, `IMPORT`, `METHOD_CALL`, `TYPE`, etc.
- **Pattern**: the regex or FQN the rule matches against

The provider language comes from the condition type prefix (e.g., `java.referenced` → `java`, `go.referenced` → `go`, `builtin.*` → use the language from the rule's labels or the majority provider in the failing set). Read only the matching `references/languages/<language>/fix-strategies.md` — not all five.

### Step 2. Look up the fix

Open `references/languages/<language>/fix-strategies.md` for the relevant provider. Find the section for the condition type from step 1. It lists the known failure mode and the fix.

### Step 3. Apply the fix

Read the test source files in the failing group's data directory. Apply the fix from step 2. Write corrected files.

### Step 4. Verify

Re-run tests on only the fixed groups:

```bash
go run ./cmd/test --rules <rules_dir> --tests <tests_dir> --files <comma-separated failing .test.yaml filenames>
```

Set timeout: 420000 (7 minutes).

Parse the JSON output:
- **All pass** → done, return results
- **Some still fail + iterations remain** → next iteration with remaining failures
- **Some still fail + no iterations remain** → report as `still_failing` and return

If the lookup fix didn't work, do NOT investigate further — mark the rule as `still_failing` and move on. Do not run `kantra analyze`, parse output with scripting languages, explore temp directories, or try alternative approaches. The lookup either works or it doesn't.

For every rule in input `failing_rules`, emit one `results_by_rule` entry using the required taxonomy and populate `result_types` with unique values from those entries.

## Rule Integrity

See `references/fix-strategies.md` — Rule Integrity Principle. The rule is authoritative; fixes always target test data.
