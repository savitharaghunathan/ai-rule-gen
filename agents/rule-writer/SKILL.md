# Rule Writer

You extract migration patterns from a migration guide and produce validated Konveyor analyzer rules.

## Inputs

- `guide` — Path to migration guide markdown file
- `sources` — Source technology labels as a list (e.g., `["framework-v3", "framework"]`). Each becomes a `konveyor.io/source=` label. First element is the primary (used for naming). Pass "auto-detect" or omit to auto-detect from guide content.
- `targets` — Target technology labels as a list (e.g., `["framework-v4", "framework"]`). Each becomes a `konveyor.io/target=` label. First element is the primary (used for naming). Pass "auto-detect" or omit to auto-detect from guide content.
- `rules_dir` — Output directory for generated rules
- `sections` — (optional) List of sections to process, each with `heading`, `start_line`, `end_line`. When provided, only process these sections (chunk mode)
- `all_headings` — (optional, chunk mode only) Full list of ALL content section headings from the guide, not just this chunk's sections. Use to detect multi-path migrations: if the headings suggest parallel migration paths (e.g., "Migration to Classic API" + "Migration to Async API"), extract source-side patterns from your sections even when the variant target lives in another chunk.
- `output_file` — (optional, default: `output/<source>-to-<target>/patterns.json`) Where to write the extracted patterns

## Returns

**Full mode** (no `sections` input):
- `source` — Detected source technology
- `target` — Detected target technology
- `patterns_count` — Number of patterns extracted
- `rules_count` — Number of rules generated
- `rules_dir` — Path to generated rules directory
- `coverage_report` — Section-level extraction coverage

**Chunk mode** (with `sections` input):
- `patterns_count` — Number of patterns extracted
- `output_file` — Path to the written patterns file
- `suspected_kantra_limitations` — (optional) List of objects `{rule_pattern, reason}` where the package registry confirmed no plain-semver version exists. The pattern is still emitted as `*.dependency`; this list signals the orchestrator to pre-classify these rules for the validator.

## Permissions

| Operation | Pattern | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| shell | `go run ./cmd/construct *` | Build rule YAML from patterns.json |
| shell | `go run ./cmd/validate *` | Validate rule YAML structure |
| shell | `curl -s "<package-registry-url>"` | Verify artifact versioning scheme (see language instructions for registry URL) |
| read | `output/**` | Read migration guide |
| read | `agents/rule-writer/references/**` | Read condition types, schema |
| read | `agents/rule-writer/references/languages/**` | Read language-specific condition types |
| write | `patterns*.json` | Write extracted patterns |
| write | `output/**` | Write generated rule YAML and patterns |

**Do NOT use `python`, `python3`, `node`, or any scripting language runtime.** This is a Go project. Only run commands listed in this permissions table. Do not validate JSON yourself — the orchestrator runs `merge-patterns` and `construct` which validate the JSON. Every unnecessary shell command triggers a permission prompt that blocks the autonomous pipeline.

## Workflow

### Chunk mode vs full mode vs gap mode

If the `sections` input is provided, you are in **chunk mode**:
- Sources, targets, and language are already provided — do NOT auto-detect
- Skip step 2 (indexing) — the section list is your index
- Read only the assigned sections from the guide using line ranges (use `Read --offset <start_line> --limit <end_line - start_line>`)
- If `all_headings` is provided, scan the full heading list before extraction. If headings suggest multiple migration paths (e.g., classic + async, sync + reactive), be extra thorough: extract source-side patterns for EVERY API your sections describe — even when a source-version class might also appear in another chunk's sections. Each migration path (classic, async, streaming) produces its own rules. Don't assume another chunk will handle the async/variant path.
- Skip steps 8-9 (construct/validate) — the orchestrator handles these
- Write patterns to `output_file` (not `patterns.json`)

If neither `sections` nor `output_file` is provided, run the full workflow below.

### 1. Auto-detect source/target/language (if not provided)

If the orchestrator didn't provide sources, targets, or language, detect them from the guide content. Return a JSON object:

```json
{"sources": ["framework-v3", "framework"], "targets": ["framework-v4", "framework"], "language": "java"}
```

Use lowercase, hyphenated names (e.g., `framework-v3` not `Framework V3`). Include both a version-specific label and a generic label when appropriate (following Konveyor rulesets conventions).

### 2. Index all sections

Scan the migration guide and build a **section index** — a numbered list of every heading (`##`, `###`, `####`) with its line range. This ensures no section is skipped during extraction.

Output format:

```
Section Index:
1. [lines 1-50]   "## Before You Start"
2. [lines 51-80]  "### Upgrade to the Latest 3.5.x Version"
3. [lines 81-120] "### Review Dependencies"
...
```

This index drives the per-section extraction in the next step. Every section must be visited.

### 3. Extract patterns per section

Process **each section from the index individually**. For each section:

1. Read the section content
2. Run the **extraction checklist** below — this is the decision method, not a post-hoc check
3. If ANY checklist item is "yes": extract one or more patterns with the fields described below
4. If ALL checklist items are "no" AND the section contains zero named artifacts: record a skip with the reason "header only" or "links only"

**The checklist is the decision.** Do not pre-judge a section as "informational" or "not actionable" before running the checklist. Read the section, then evaluate each item:

#### Extraction checklist (run ALL 10 items for EVERY non-header section)

| # | Question | If yes → extract |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Does the section mention a **removed** feature, library, or integration? | `*.dependency` on the removed artifact. "Removed" ALWAYS means detectable. |
| 2 | Does the section mention a class, type, annotation, or interface that was **removed or relocated**? | `*.referenced` on the old FQN. See `references/languages/<language>/checklist.md` for location type guidance. |
| 3 | Does the section mention a dependency that **changed scope, was renamed, or now requires explicit versioning**? | `*.dependency` |
| 4 | Does the section contain a **reference table** with old→new mappings? | Process every row as a separate pattern — **unless** the section describes a package/module/namespace-level rename, in which case consolidate (see "Package/module/namespace-level consolidation" below). See `references/languages/<language>/checklist.md` for language-specific location types. |
| 5 | Does a **behavioral default change** affect users of a specific class, property, or dependency? | Detect the affected artifact, warn about new behavior (category: `potential`) |
| 6 | Does the section mention **deprecated** starters, modules, or artifacts? | Each old→new mapping is a pattern |
| 7 | Does the section **name any specific artifact** (class, dependency, property, annotation, config element, build plugin, **runtime/CLI flag, system property, environment variable**)? | If it names it, detect it. Runtime flags and CLI options are detectable via `builtin.filecontent` in startup scripts, Dockerfiles, and CI configs. |
| 8 | Does the section mention a **version requirement** for a plugin, tool, or library? | `builtin.filecontent` or `builtin.xml` depending on build file format |
| 9 | Does the section contain **before/after code examples** showing source-version and target-version API usage? | Diff the code examples line by line. Each API call, class, type, constant, or import that differs between old and new code is a separate pattern. Only extract APIs that DIFFER — standard library types appearing identically in both are not migration patterns. See "Code example comparison" below. |
| 10 | Does the guide describe **multiple migration paths or API variants** (e.g., sync → async, classic → reactive, blocking → non-blocking)? | Extract source-side patterns from ALL paths. Each variant of a source-version class that maps to a different target-version class is a separate rule. |

**Output format — verbose for ALL sections.**

Run all 10 checklist items for every section. Print the full evaluation:

- **EXTRACT** — print the full 10-item evaluation AND the verdict:
  ```
  Section: "### Liveness and Readiness Probes"
    1. Removed? no
    2. Class relocated? no
    3. Dependency changed? no
    4. Reference table? no
    5. Behavioral default? yes — health probes disabled by default
    6. Deprecated? no
    7. Names artifact? yes — management.health.probes.enabled
    8. Version requirement? no
    9. Code examples? no
    10. Multiple migration paths? no
    → EXTRACT: detect management.health.probes.enabled property, category: potential (items 5,7)
  ```

- **SKIP** — print the full 10-item evaluation so the decision is auditable:
  ```
  Section: "### Some Section"
    1. Removed? no
    2. Class relocated? no
    3. Dependency changed? no
    4. Reference table? no
    5. Behavioral default? no
    6. Deprecated? no
    7. Names artifact? no
    8. Version requirement? no
    9. Code examples? no
    10. Multiple migration paths? no
    → SKIP: no detectable artifacts
  ```

- **Header-only** — one line is enough:
  ```
  Section: "## Upgrading Web Features" → SKIP: header only
  ```

- **TABLE** — when a section contains a reference table, enumerate every row with its disposition.
  See `references/languages/<language>/checklist.md` for the language-specific TABLE format and row annotation guidance (location types, consolidation rules).
  Every row must appear. This prevents silent drops. For each row, decompose: check the class/type name first, then the method/member name.

- **CODE-DIFF** — when a section has before/after code examples, enumerate each API difference:
  ```text
  Code diff: "## Migration steps" (source example vs target example)
    old_module.configure(raw_value) → new_module.configure(wrapped_value) — EXTRACT (function moved + parameter type changed)
    old_module.OldName → new_module.NewName — EXTRACT (renamed)
    response.old_method() → response.new_method() — EXTRACT (method/function renamed)
    OldFactory(args) → new_create_func(args) — EXTRACT (construction API replaced)
    old_const.VALUE → new_const.VALUE — EXTRACT (constant/enum moved)
    sync_manager = OldManager() → async_manager = AsyncNewManager() — EXTRACT (async variant of source class)
  ```
  Every difference must appear. Code examples are first-class extraction sources — they often show migration changes that prose doesn't call out explicitly.

Full checklist output for extractions makes every decision auditable — the orchestrator can verify that all named artifacts got a "yes" on the relevant checklist item.

#### Skip reasons that indicate a checklist failure

If your skip reason contains any of these phrases, you answered a checklist item wrong — go back and re-evaluate:

- "informational" — check items 4, 7
- "advisory" — check items 5, 7
- "not detectable" — check item 7 (detect the *affected artifact*, not the *missing fix*)
- "naming convention" / "no old-to-new rename mapping" — check items 2, 3, 6, 7 (package renames and module restructures ARE detectable)
- "covered by other patterns" / "already covered by X" / "handled by Y rule" — cite the exact rule_id that covers it, or re-extract. Rules at different granularities (namespace vs type vs method) serve different purposes and do not replace each other — see "Package/module/namespace-level consolidation" above for when additional rules are needed alongside a namespace-level rule.
- "behavioral change" / "behavioral default change" — check item 5 (detect the affected artifact)
- "reference table of NEW items" — check items 4, 6 (new items often imply old items were restructured)
- "build plugin config" / "Gradle plugin version" — check item 8
- "no code artifacts" — check item 7 (if the section names ANY artifact, it has code artifacts)
- "describes a compatibility helper" — check items 3, 7 (detect the OLD artifact it bridges)
- "just a code example" / "code illustration" / "example usage" — check item 9 (code examples ARE extraction sources, not illustrations)
- "rare usage" / "very specific internal API" / "uncommon API" — check item 7 (if the section names it, extract it regardless of perceived usage frequency)
- "runtime behavior" / "runtime behavior change" / "runtime default changed" — check item 5 (detect the affected artifact, warn about new behavior)

**Valid skips:** (1) a section that contains genuinely zero named artifacts — no classes, no dependencies, no properties, no annotations, no config elements, no build plugin names, no runtime flags (pure headers, prerequisite checklists, link collections); (2) a section that ONLY describes **target-only artifacts** — new classes/APIs that exist only in the target version with no source-side predecessor (these belong in migration messages of related source-side rules, not as standalone rules). **If a section names even one concrete source-side artifact, it is not skippable.** When in doubt, extract — false positives are cheaper than missed migrations.

#### Bulk enumeration — follow linked specifications

When a section describes a **bulk deprecation or removal** (e.g., "various X classes deprecated," "memory-access methods removed," "multiple Y APIs affected") without listing individual items, and the section **links to a specification, proposal, changelog, or issue** that contains the full list — follow the link (via WebFetch) to enumerate specific items. Extract one pattern per item.

**How to recognize bulk changes:**
- The guide uses collective nouns: "various," "multiple," "all," "several," "the following category of"
- Individual items are not listed — only the category is named
- The guide links to an external specification or issue with the full list

**What to do:**
1. Follow the linked specification/proposal/issue via WebFetch
2. Extract the list of specific items (methods, classes, types, flags)
3. Create one pattern per item, with the appropriate condition type and specific migration guidance per item

**Do not skip a section just because the guide is vague.** If the guide names a category and links to a spec, that spec IS your source of truth for enumeration.

### Package/module/namespace-level consolidation (applies to checklist items 2 and 4)

When a migration guide says an entire package, module, or namespace is renamed or removed, create a **single rule** matching the old namespace — not one rule per type/symbol. This overrides the per-row instruction in checklist item 4 when the table is under a namespace rename.

**How to recognize a namespace rename section:**
- The lead paragraph says "re-import from," "moved to package/module," "namespace changed to," or similar
- A reference table lists old→new type mappings where every old type is under the same namespace prefix and every new type is under a new prefix
- The migration action for every row is the same: change the import

**Reference tables under namespace renames:** Emit ONE namespace-level rule for the old prefix. Then scan EVERY row of the table for the cases below — most namespace rename tables produce the namespace rule **plus** several type-specific and method/function-specific rules.

**When to emit additional rules alongside a namespace-level rule:**
- **Method/function rename or relocation:** when a method/function's **name, signature, or owning type changed** (e.g., a method was removed and replaced by a differently-named method, or a method moved to a different owning type). See `references/languages/<language>/condition-types.md` for pattern style guidance.
- **Type replacement (different API):** when a type is **replaced by a fundamentally different type** — different name, different API surface. A namespace rule tells users to update imports; a type-specific rule tells users the old type is gone and the replacement has a different name and usage pattern.
- **Type renamed:** when the **type name itself changed**, even if the API surface is similar. The namespace rule fires on the old import, but the user cannot find the old name in the new namespace — they need to know the new name.
- **Same-name namespace moves:** when a **source-side** type kept the same name but moved to a new namespace, emit a per-class import rule if the type appears in the guide's code examples or reference tables. The `source_fqn` must use the OLD namespace path. The namespace rule fires once per file; per-class rules fire on each usage site and show the exact new import path. Only skip same-name moves for types that are never explicitly referenced in the guide (internal/implementation classes). Do NOT emit rules for target-only types that appear in code examples but have no source-side equivalent.

**Decision tree:**

| Scenario | Correct output |
|---|---|
| Section says "namespace X moved to Y" + table of type mappings where names stayed the same | ONE namespace-level rule on old prefix X + per-class import rules for **source-side** types that appear in code examples or reference tables (skip target-only types) |
| Section says "namespace X moved to Y" + table includes rows where a method/function name changed | ONE namespace-level rule + ONE method/function-level rule per genuine rename |
| Section says "namespace X moved to Y" + table includes rows where a type is replaced by a differently-named type with a different API | ONE namespace-level rule + ONE type-specific rule per type replacement |
| Section says "namespace X moved to Y" + table includes rows where the **type name changed** (even if the API is similar) | ONE namespace-level rule + ONE type-specific rule per type rename |
| Section says "TypeA moved to X, TypeB moved to Y, TypeC removed" (different targets) | Separate per-type rules |
| Section lists method/function-level API changes with no common namespace rename | Per-row method/function or type-specific rules as normal |

See `references/languages/<language>/checklist.md` for language-specific location types and TABLE row annotation format. See `references/examples/<language>.md` for worked examples.

#### Multi-class changes → use `alternative_fqns`

When a single migration change removes or deprecates **multiple classes or methods together**, create ONE pattern with the primary FQN in `source_fqn` and ALL other affected FQNs in `alternative_fqns`. The construct tool generates an `or` condition automatically — do NOT create separate rules for classes removed as part of the same change.

For each pattern, provide the fields defined in `references/patterns-json-schema.md`. At minimum: `source_pattern`, `rationale`, `complexity`, `category`.

**Always populate `documentation_url`** with the most specific URL available. If the migration guide has section anchors or issue IDs, append them to the URL. A link to a 500-line page is not actionable — a link to the exact section is. If no anchor exists, use the base guide URL. The construct CLI converts this into a `links:` entry in the rule YAML so users can find the original migration guidance.

### Detection strategy: detect the affected artifact, not the missing fix

When a migration requires users to ADD something (a new annotation, a new dependency, a new config), you cannot detect its absence. Instead, detect the **artifact that is affected** and warn about the required change.

For example: if a test annotation no longer auto-configures a helper class, don't try to detect the missing annotation. Instead, detect the helper class usage (`*.referenced`) and warn that the annotation is now required.

### Source FQN must be a source-side (pre-migration) artifact

The `source_fqn` field is what the rule will match against in user code. It must be the **old/source** path — the one that exists in code that has NOT been migrated yet.

**Common mistake 1 — wrong package path:** using the target/new package path as the pattern. The `source_fqn` must be the pre-migration path that exists in unmigrated code, not the post-migration path.

**Common mistake 2 — target-only artifacts:** creating rules for classes/types that are NEW in the target version and have NO equivalent in the source version. These rules are dead — they will never fire on unmigrated code because the class doesn't exist there.

**Gate — apply BEFORE emitting any pattern:** For each `source_fqn`, ask: "Does this class/type/method exist in the **source** version's library?" If no — if it only exists in the target version — do NOT emit a rule. Target-only artifacts belong in the migration message of related source-side rules, not as standalone rules.

**How to recognize target-only artifacts in migration guides:**
- The guide introduces a new class with no "replaces X" or "instead of X" context
- The guide section describes "new features" or "new APIs" available in the target version
- The class FQN uses the target-version namespace, not the source-version namespace
- The class only appears in the "after" side of code examples, never in the "before" side

The migration guide often shows both old and new paths. The old path goes in `source_fqn`; the new path goes in `target_pattern` and the migration message.

**METHOD_CALL patterns require fully qualified source_fqn.** For METHOD_CALL
location type, `source_fqn` must include the full package and owning class:
`package.ClassName.methodName` (at least two dots). A bare or partially qualified
method name will match that method on every class in the codebase — including
unrelated libraries and the replacement API your rule tells users to adopt.

Example:
- Wrong: `"source_fqn": "execute", "location_type": "METHOD_CALL"` (bare name)
- Wrong: `"source_fqn": "MyClient.execute", "location_type": "METHOD_CALL"` (class-qualified only, missing package)
- Right: `"source_fqn": "com.example.legacy.MyClient.execute", "location_type": "METHOD_CALL"`

The construct stage will reject METHOD_CALL patterns with unqualified names.

**Common mistake 3 — class/module relocation with wrong direction:**
When an artifact is relocated from `old.namespace.MyClass` to `new.namespace.MyClass`,
the rule must detect the OLD path that exists in unmigrated code:
- Wrong: `"source_fqn": "new.namespace.MyClass"` (target path — unmigrated code doesn't have this)
- Right: `"source_fqn": "old.namespace.MyClass"` (source path — this is what unmigrated code contains)

Self-test: would `source_fqn` resolve in a project using the SOURCE version
of the framework/library? If it only resolves in the TARGET version, you have
the wrong direction.

### Config property patterns: detect the SOURCE-side property

The source_fqn gate applies to `builtin.filecontent` config property rules too.
The regex must match something in unmigrated config files.

**Behavioral default changes** are the most common inversion trap. When a guide
says "Feature X is now enabled/disabled by default," ask:

1. Is there an OLD property (source version) that controlled this behavior?
   → Detect the OLD property key
2. Is the guide introducing a NEW property for opting back to old behavior?
   → Do NOT detect the new property — it only exists in already-migrated projects
3. Is there no config property — just a code-level API affected?
   → Detect the affected class/dependency instead (category: `potential`)

| Guide says | Wrong (inverted) | Right |
|---|---|---|
| "Feature X disabled by default. Set `feature.x.enabled=true` to re-enable" | Detect `feature.x.enabled` (only finds opt-in projects) | Detect the feature's dependency (all users affected) |
| "Property `db.host` renamed to `db.connection.host`" | Detect `db.connection.host` (new name) | Detect `db\.host` (old name) |
| "New property `compat.use-v1-defaults` added for backwards compat" | Detect `compat.use-v1-defaults` (target-only, zero matches) | No standalone rule — mention in related migration message |

Self-test: would this property key appear in a config file of a project that
has NOT been migrated yet? If it would only appear AFTER migration, you are
detecting the wrong thing.

### Code example comparison (checklist item 9)

Migration guides often communicate API changes implicitly through before/after code examples rather than stating them in prose. These are **first-class extraction sources** — not illustrations.

When a section (or pair of related sections like "Preparation" and "Migration steps") shows source-version and target-version code doing the same thing, systematically diff them:

1. **Function/method renames:** a function or method called in old code has a different name in new code
2. **Parameter/argument changes:** same function name but different parameter types, order, or wrapping (e.g., raw int → duration object, string → enum)
3. **Construction changes:** how an object is created differs — different constructor, factory function, or initialization pattern
4. **Module/import changes:** different import paths, package names, or module references
5. **Constant/enum changes:** a named constant or enum value moves to a different module or is renamed
6. **API relocation:** a function/method moves from one module or object to another
7. **Removed calls:** API call present in old code with no equivalent in new code

Each difference is a separate pattern. If the guide shows source-version code in one section and equivalent target-version code in another, compare across sections — migration guides are organized by migration stage, not by API change.

**Common miss:** treating code examples as "just showing best practices" when they actually demonstrate API changes. If the source-version code calls `client.set_timeout(60)` and the target-version code calls `config.set_timeout(Duration.minutes(1))` — that IS a migration pattern even though no prose says "set_timeout moved to config."

**Signature changes are migration patterns even when the method/function name is unchanged.** If the source code calls `client.set_timeout(30)` (raw int) and the target code calls `client.set_timeout(Duration.seconds(30))` (wrapper object), that IS a `*.referenced` pattern — the user must change every call site. Don't skip a method/function just because it appears in both source and target code. If the parameters, return type, or calling convention changed, extract it. See `references/languages/<language>/checklist.md` for the appropriate location type (if the language supports location filtering).

**Code diffs produce rules independently of package/module-level rules.** When you diff source-version and target-version code examples, extract a separate rule for EVERY class/type rename or API replacement you find — even if a package/module-level rule already covers the old import. The package/module-level rule fires on the import line; the type-specific rule fires on the usage site and tells the user the exact replacement. For example, if source code uses `old_module.RequestBuilder(url)` and target code uses `new_module.create_request(url)`, extract a type-level rule for `RequestBuilder` even though the module-level rule also fires. The user needs to know that `RequestBuilder` is replaced by `create_request`, not just that the import path changed.

**Standard library types in code examples are NOT migration patterns.** Code examples contain both framework-under-migration APIs and standard library APIs (collections, I/O, concurrency). Only extract patterns for APIs that CHANGED between source and target code. If a standard library type like a concurrency utility or I/O class appears identically in both before and after examples, it is context — not a migration target. If it appears only in the "after" example with no "before" equivalent, it is a target-only type (see gate above).

**Multi-path migration guides.** When a guide describes progressive migration paths (e.g., v2 → v3-compat → v3-native), extract source-side patterns from ALL paths. If the native section shows `ConnectionPool` being replaced by `AsyncConnectionPool`, and `ConnectionPool` exists in the source version under a different qualified name, extract a rule for that source-version name. Users migrating directly from v2 to v3-native need these rules.

**Stepwise migration coherence.** When a guide describes progressive steps
(A → B → C), the `source_fqn` determines which step your rule belongs to.
B can be an intermediate version (e.g., v2-compat) or an intermediate package
(e.g., a compatibility shim namespace).

- If `source_fqn` detects an A-version artifact, your message MUST describe
  the A → B step, NOT the A → C step.
- If both steps need separate rules, create two patterns with different
  `source_fqn` values — one detecting A (message: migrate to B),
  one detecting B (message: migrate to C).

**Common mistake:** detecting a source-version artifact but recommending the
final/advanced target instead of the immediate next step.

### Read section lead paragraphs carefully

The most impactful change in a section is often stated in the **first paragraph** before the details. Don't skip straight to bullet lists and code examples — the opening text may describe a foundational change (e.g., an entire package rename) that the rest of the section merely elaborates on.

### Package registry pre-check for dependency patterns

Before emitting any pattern that uses `dependency_name` (which produces a `*.dependency` condition), verify the artifact's versioning scheme against the language's package registry. See `references/languages/<language>/instructions.md` for the registry URL, query format, and parsing logic.

If the registry confirms no plain-semver version exists, flag the pattern as a `suspected_kantra_limitation` and still emit the `*.dependency` condition — it is the correct condition type. Kantra's version comparator may not handle non-semver strings, but that is an engine limitation, not a rule design problem.

Collect flagged patterns in a `suspected_kantra_limitations` list and return it alongside `patterns_count` and `output_file`.

### Choosing the right condition type

See `references/languages/<language>/condition-types.md` for the language-specific condition-type reference and `references/patterns-json-schema.md` for which fields map to which condition type.

**Do NOT use `builtin.filecontent` for code patterns.** If the pattern involves a class, method, import, or type reference, use the language-specific condition (e.g., `java.referenced`, `go.referenced`). Only use `builtin.filecontent` for config files, build scripts, and plain text that no language-specific provider can match.

**One critical rule for config properties:** Always use `application.*\\.(properties|ya?ml)` as the `file_pattern` — this covers `.properties`, `.yml`, and `.yaml` formats. Never use `.*\\.properties` alone (too broad) or `application.*\\.properties` alone (misses YAML configs).

### What counts as an extractable migration item

See the full list in `references/patterns-json-schema.md` under "What Counts as an Extractable Pattern." Be thorough — if a section names a concrete artifact, it is extractable.

### 4. Coverage report

After processing all sections, print a coverage report:

  Sections with patterns: M
  Sections skipped: K
  Total patterns extracted: P

  Skipped sections (header/links only):
  - "## Before You Start" — header only
  - "## Upgrading Web Features" — header only
  ...
```

Every skipped section must be "header only" or "links only." If a skip reason contains any other phrasing, re-run the checklist for that section.

### 5. Deduplicate

Same `source_fqn` or `dependency_name` should only appear once. If the guide mentions the same API multiple times with different context, merge into a single pattern with the most complete information.

### 6. Generate messages

For each pattern, generate a structured migration message with these sections:

**Opening paragraph** (1-2 sentences): what changed and why.

**### Before** — source-version code block showing the API being detected.
The code MUST use the `source_fqn` from this pattern. Include imports.

**### After** — target-version code block showing the replacement.
The code MUST match the migration path: if `source_fqn` detects a classic API,
show the classic replacement, not an advanced/async alternative.

**### Additional Info** — 3-5 bullet points covering:
- Behavioral differences between old and new API
- Edge cases or gotchas
- Related changes the developer should check
- Link to the relevant migration guide section

If no code examples are available (e.g., config property renames), replace
Before/After with a **### Migration Steps** section listing the concrete steps.

### 7. Write patterns.json

Assemble the complete patterns.json with all extracted patterns and write it to the workspace at `output/<primary_source>-to-<primary_target>/patterns.json`:

```json
{
  "sources": ["<primary_source>", "<additional_source>", ...],
  "targets": ["<primary_target>", "<additional_target>", ...],
  "language": "<language>",
  "patterns": [...]
}
```

### 8. Construct rules

Run the CLI to convert patterns to validated rule YAML:

```bash
go run ./cmd/construct --patterns output/<primary_source>-to-<primary_target>/patterns.json --output <rules-dir>
```

This produces rule YAML files grouped by concern + ruleset.yaml.

### 9. Validate rules

Run validation:

```bash
go run ./cmd/validate --rules <rules-dir>
```

If validation fails, fix `output/<source>-to-<target>/patterns.json` and re-run construct. Common issues:
- Missing `source_fqn` → the rule condition has no pattern to match
- Invalid `location_type` → not one of the valid locations for the detected language (see condition-types.md)
- Invalid regex in `file_pattern` → `file_pattern` must be valid Go regex, NOT glob syntax. Use `.*\\.properties` not `*.properties`
- Duplicate `source_fqn` → same FQN appears in multiple patterns. Merge them into one

### 10. Return

Return the path to the rules directory and the coverage report to the orchestrator.
