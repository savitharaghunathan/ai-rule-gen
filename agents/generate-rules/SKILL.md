# Generate Konveyor Migration Rules

Generate Konveyor analyzer migration rules from a migration guide.

**Input:** $ARGUMENTS (URL, file path, or pasted text of a migration guide)

If no argument is provided, ask the user for the migration guide source.

**IMPORTANT — Fresh run every time:** Each invocation creates a new timestamped output directory. Do NOT scan `output/` for previous runs, do NOT reuse existing directories, do NOT check for prior results. Start step 1 immediately. The only exception is when the user explicitly provides `migration_dir` with `resume_from`.

## Inputs

- `guide_source` — URL, file path, or pasted text of a migration guide
- `sources` — (optional) Source technology labels as a list, e.g. `["spring-boot3", "spring-boot"]`. Each becomes a `konveyor.io/source=` label. First element is the primary (used for naming). Auto-detected if omitted.
- `targets` — (optional) Target technology labels as a list, e.g. `["spring-boot4", "spring-boot"]`. Each becomes a `konveyor.io/target=` label. First element is the primary (used for naming). Auto-detected if omitted.
- `mode` — (optional) `interactive` (default) or `non_interactive`
- `checkpoint_behavior` — (optional) `ask` (default), `continue`, or `stop_after_extract`
- `resume_from` — (optional) `ingest`, `extract`, `coverage`, `scaffold`, `test`, `report`
- `migration_dir` — (optional) explicit output directory override. If omitted, auto-generated as `output/<primary_source>-to-<primary_target>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>`. Required when using `resume_from`.

## Returns

- `rules_dir` — Path to generated rule YAML files
- `tests_dir` — Path to test data
- `report` — Path to report.yaml
- `summary` — Markdown summary table with:
  - rules_count, passed, failed, pass_rate
  - coverage_report (sections processed/skipped)
  - fix_iterations used

## Execution Modes

- `interactive` mode: ask at checkpoint only when `checkpoint_behavior=ask`
- `non_interactive` mode: never prompt the user; obey `checkpoint_behavior`
  - `continue`: run full pipeline
  - `stop_after_extract`: end after extraction/coverage with untested outputs
  - `ask`: treated as `continue` (no prompt allowed in non-interactive mode)

**Do NOT use `python`, `python3`, `node`, or any scripting language runtime.**
**Do NOT use `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `wc`, `find`, or other shell text-processing tools to parse data that CLI commands already return.**
Every `go run ./cmd/*` command returns structured JSON. Use that JSON output directly — do not pipe it through shell commands to extract fields.
This is a Go project. Run only commands listed in this permissions table.
If a required action is not permitted, stop and report the limitation.

## UX Principles

- Emit short status lines continuously (start + finish for each step).
- Only ask at checkpoint when `mode=interactive` and `checkpoint_behavior=ask`.
- Do not block after testing starts; continue even if some rules remain failing.
- Fix only failing rules, not the full suite.

For sub-agent invocation protocol and contract validation, see `references/orchestrator-details.md` (Sub-agent Protocol section).

## Pipeline

**Error handling:** If any CLI command (`ingest`, `construct`, `validate`, `scaffold`, `sanitize`, `test`, `report`) exits non-zero, print `[step] FAILED — <error>` and stop the pipeline. Do not proceed to the next step.

**Partial failures:** If a step produces partial results before failing (e.g., `construct` succeeds for 48 patterns but fails on 2), preserve the partial output and report what succeeded. The user can fix the failing patterns and re-run. Do not discard valid results because of a partial failure.

**Resume behavior:** When `resume_from` is set, the user must also provide `migration_dir` pointing to the specific timestamped directory to resume. Skip prior stages and validate prerequisites first. Fail fast when required artifacts are missing.

Stage prerequisites (paths relative to `<migration_dir>`):
- `extract` requires `guide.md`
- `coverage` requires `patterns.json`
- `scaffold` requires `rules/`
- `test` requires `rules/` and `tests/manifest.json`
- `report` requires source/target metadata plus pass/fail totals and rule ID lists

### 1. Ingest

Generate a timestamp once at pipeline start (`YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` in local time).

Determine the migration directory path:
- If the user provided `migration_dir`, use that (no timestamp)
- If the user provided `sources` and `targets` (or `source` and `target`), use `output/<primary_source>-to-<primary_target>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>` where `primary_source` is `sources[0]` and `primary_target` is `targets[0]`
- If auto-detecting: ingest to `output/guide-temp.md` first, read the first ~50 lines to detect source/target/language (lowercase, hyphenated names like `spring-boot-3`), then use `output/<source>-to-<target>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>`

```bash
mkdir -p output/<source>-to-<target>-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>
```

Every `go run` command should be a standalone invocation with fully-expanded arguments — substitute actual paths and flag values directly into each command. Do not use shell variable assignments (`VAR=...`) or compound `&&` chains, since these don't match the permissions table.

The log flags are: `--log <migration_dir>/pipeline.log --agent orchestrator --model <your_model_id>`. Append these literally to every CLI invocation.

```
[ingest] Fetching guide from <source>...
```

- **URL:** `go run ./cmd/ingest --log <migration_dir>/pipeline.log --agent orchestrator --model <your_model_id> --input <url> --output <migration_dir>/guide.md`
- **File (not markdown):** `go run ./cmd/ingest --log <migration_dir>/pipeline.log --agent orchestrator --model <your_model_id> --input <path> --output <migration_dir>/guide.md`
- **Pasted text or already markdown:** Write directly to `<migration_dir>/guide.md`

If auto-detecting, write `output/guide-temp.md` to `<migration_dir>/guide.md` using the Write tool after the migration directory path is determined.

Count lines (`GUIDE_LINES`) and section headings. Print:

```
[ingest] Done — <GUIDE_LINES> lines, <N> sections → <migration_dir>/ (<elapsed>)
```

### 2. Extract (parallel)

Extraction uses parallel agents to process the guide faster. The orchestrator splits the guide into chunks and spawns multiple rule-writer agents.

**2a. Index sections and auto-detect metadata:**

```bash
go run ./cmd/sections <log_flags> --guide <migration_dir>/guide.md
```

This returns JSON with all sections classified as `content` or `header-only`. Filter to content sections only.

```
[extract] Extracting patterns from <content_count> sections (<N> parallel agents)...
```

**2b. Split into chunks and dispatch:**

Split the content sections into **N balanced chunks** (minimum 1, maximum 5 agents). Balance by section count. Assign each chunk a number (1, 2, ..., N).

**Keep related sections together.** Group sections by their top-level heading (`##`) — all subsections (`###`, `####`) under the same `##` must stay in the same chunk. Migration guides pair before/after code examples across subsections within a topic; splitting them across agents means no agent sees both sides of the diff. Balance chunks by top-level-heading groups, not by individual sections.

**Invoke:** `rule-writer` (one per chunk, in parallel)
**Purpose:** Extract migration patterns from assigned sections.
**Inputs per invocation:**
  - guide: <migration_dir>/guide.md
  - sources: {sources array (e.g., ["spring-boot3", "spring-boot"])}
  - targets: {targets array (e.g., ["spring-boot4", "spring-boot"])}
  - rules_dir: <migration_dir>/rules
  - sections: {chunk subset — list of `{heading, start_line, end_line}` objects}
  - all_headings: {full list of ALL content section headings from step 2a — not just this chunk's sections. Enables each agent to detect multi-path migrations even when variant sections are in other chunks.}
  - output_file: <migration_dir>/patterns-{chunk_number}.json
**Parallel:** yes
**Expect:**
  - patterns_count, output_file

**2c. Merge, verify, and construct:**

After all agents complete, merge the partial patterns files, verify source artifacts, and build rules:

```bash
go run ./cmd/merge-patterns <log_flags> --output <migration_dir>/patterns.json <migration_dir>/patterns-1.json <migration_dir>/patterns-2.json ...
go run ./cmd/verify <log_flags> --patterns <migration_dir>/patterns.json --output <migration_dir>/verify-results.json --cache <migration_dir>/verify-cache
go run ./cmd/construct <log_flags> --patterns <migration_dir>/patterns.json --output <migration_dir>/rules
go run ./cmd/validate <log_flags> --rules <migration_dir>/rules
```

**Verification step:** `cmd/verify` downloads source JARs from Maven Central and checks that each pattern's `source_fqn` exists in the declared `source_artifact`. This catches hallucinated class names before rules reach testing.

The verify stdout JSON contains `verified`, `not_found`, `skipped`, and `offline` counts. Print:

```
[verify] <verified> verified, <not_found> not found, <skipped> skipped
```

If `not_found > 0`, read `<migration_dir>/verify-results.json` and note which `pattern_index` values have `status: "not_found"`. After construct runs, use the `pattern_rule_map` from construct's stdout JSON to map each `pattern_index` → `rule_id`. Carry `verified_rule_ids` and `not_found_rule_ids` forward to step 5 (report).

If validation fails, fix `<migration_dir>/patterns.json` (remove invalid entries) and re-run construct.

```
[extract] Done — <patterns_count> patterns → <rules_count> rules in <migration_dir>/rules/ (<elapsed>)
```

Save `source`, `target`, `patterns_count`, `rules_count`, and verify counts for the final summary.

### 2d. Coverage Check

Run the coverage tool to find sections with named artifacts that weren't extracted:

```bash
go run ./cmd/coverage <log_flags> --guide <migration_dir>/guide.md --patterns <migration_dir>/patterns.json --language <language>
```

If `gap_count > 0` in the JSON output, print:

```
[coverage] <gap_count> sections with uncovered artifacts: <heading_1>, <heading_2>, ...
```

Convert gaps to sections and send back to the rule-writer in chunk mode for targeted re-extraction. Each gap has `heading` and `line` — use the sections index to get the `start_line` and `end_line` for that heading. Mention the uncovered artifacts in the prompt so the sub-agent focuses on them.

**Invoke:** `rule-writer` (chunk mode)
**Purpose:** Extract patterns from specific sections that the coverage check flagged.
**Inputs:**
  - guide: <migration_dir>/guide.md
  - sources: {sources array}
  - targets: {targets array}
  - rules_dir: <migration_dir>/rules
  - sections: {gap sections converted to `[{heading, start_line, end_line}]` format}
  - output_file: <migration_dir>/patterns-gaps.json
**Parallel:** no
**Expect:**
  - patterns_count, output_file

The sub-agent writes only the new patterns to `<migration_dir>/patterns-gaps.json`. It does NOT read or inspect existing patterns — the orchestrator handles deduplication. After the sub-agent returns, merge, verify, and rebuild:

```bash
go run ./cmd/merge-patterns <log_flags> --output <migration_dir>/patterns.json <migration_dir>/patterns.json <migration_dir>/patterns-gaps.json
go run ./cmd/verify <log_flags> --patterns <migration_dir>/patterns.json --output <migration_dir>/verify-results.json --cache <migration_dir>/verify-cache
go run ./cmd/construct <log_flags> --patterns <migration_dir>/patterns.json --output <migration_dir>/rules
go run ./cmd/validate <log_flags> --rules <migration_dir>/rules
```

Re-run the coverage check. If gaps remain, accept them — one re-extraction pass is enough.

```
[coverage] Done — <final_gap_count> remaining gaps (accepted) (<elapsed>)
```

If `gap_count == 0`:

```
[coverage] No gaps found (<elapsed>)
```

### Checkpoint

After extraction/coverage:

- If `mode=non_interactive`, do **not** prompt:
  - `checkpoint_behavior=continue` or `ask`: continue automatically
  - `checkpoint_behavior=stop_after_extract`: skip testing and go to Step 6
- If `mode=interactive`:
  - `checkpoint_behavior=continue`: continue automatically
  - `checkpoint_behavior=stop_after_extract`: skip testing and go to Step 6
  - `checkpoint_behavior=ask`: ask:
    - `Continue with test generation and validation? (y/n)`
    - if no, skip to Step 6 with untested rules

### 3. Test Generation

**3a. Scaffold (orchestrator runs this directly, not an agent):**

```bash
go run ./cmd/scaffold <log_flags> --rules <migration_dir>/rules --output <migration_dir>/tests
```

This creates all directories, `.test.yaml` files, and `manifest.json`. No LLM needed.

**3b. Read manifest and split into batches:**

Read `<migration_dir>/tests/manifest.json`. It contains a `groups` array — each group has `name`, `data_dir`, `files` (paths to generate), and `rule_ids`.

Split the groups into **batches of ~5 groups each** (minimum 1 batch, maximum 5 batches), balanced by rule count.

**3c. Spawn test-generator agents:**

```
[test-gen] Generating test data for <rules_count> rules (<B> parallel agents)...
```

**Invoke:** `test-generator` (one per batch, up to 5 in parallel)
**Purpose:** Generate compilable test source code that triggers the assigned rules.
**Inputs per invocation:**
  - rules_dir: <migration_dir>/rules
  - tests_dir: <migration_dir>/tests
  - groups: {batch subset from manifest.json — include name, data_dir, rule_ids, files}
**Parallel:** yes
**Expect:**
  - groups_completed, files_written

**3d. Collect results and sanitize.** After all agents complete:

Collect `suspected_kantra_limitations` from all rule-writer and test-generator agent returns (merge, deduplicate by `rule_id`). If non-empty, print:

```
[test-gen] <N> suspected kantra limitations (Maven Central: no plain-semver version): <rule_id_1>, ...
```

Carry this merged list forward as `pre_classified_kantra_limitations` — it will be passed to the rule-validator to skip the fix loop for these rules.

Sanitize XML:

```bash
go run ./cmd/sanitize <log_flags> --dir <migration_dir>/tests/data
```

```
[test-gen] Done — <total_groups> groups, <total_files> files (<elapsed>)
```

### 4. Validate (orchestrator-driven loop)

The orchestrator runs tests and uses a sub-agent for LLM-driven repairs on failures.

**4a. Run tests:**

```bash
go run ./cmd/test <log_flags> --rules <migration_dir>/rules --tests <migration_dir>/tests --timeout 5m
```

The CLI runs each test file sequentially and automatically retries timed-out files once (`--retry-timeouts`, on by default). Tests run locally via `--run-local=true`. To run a subset, use `--files` with bare filenames (e.g., `--files data-1.test.yaml,data-2.test.yaml`), resolved relative to `--tests` dir.

Print the result:

```
[validate] <total_passed>/<total_rules> passed (<elapsed>)
```

Or if failures:

```
[validate] <total_passed>/<total_rules> passed — <F> failures: <rule_id_1>, <rule_id_2>, ...
```

If all passed (elapsed shown above), skip to step 5.

**4b. Fix (only if failures):**

```
[fix] Fixing <F> failures: <rule_id_1>, <rule_id_2> ...
```

**Invoke:** `rule-validator`
**Purpose:** Fix test data for failing rules so they pass kantra validation.
**Inputs:**
  - rules_dir: <migration_dir>/rules
  - tests_dir: <migration_dir>/tests
  - failing_rules: {list with rule_id, test_file, error for each failure}
  - pre_classified_kantra_limitations: {merged list from rule-writer and test-generator suspected_kantra_limitations — may be empty}
  - max_iterations: 1
**Parallel:** no
**Expect:**
  - fixed_rules, still_failing, kantra_limitation_rules, iterations_used, fix_details
  - results_by_rule (with `result_type` + `recommended_action`)

The validator agent owns the fix-verify loop — it fixes files, re-runs tests via `cmd/test`, and iterates up to `max_iterations`. Default is 1 iteration; pass up to 3 if the user requests more attempts.

**The orchestrator must NOT run its own fix attempts.** Do not manually edit test files, create stub classes, toggle analysisParams, or retry. All fix work goes through the rule-validator sub-agent. When the validator returns `still_failing`, accept that result and move on.

Print the result:

```
[fix] <fixed_count> fixed, <still_failing_count> still failing, <kantra_limitation_count> kantra limitations (<validate elapsed>)
```

The `<validate elapsed>` is the total time since the validate stage started (step 4a), including test runs and all fix iterations.

If `kantra_limitation_rules` is non-empty, print:

```
[fix] kantra limitations (engine cannot test — rule is correct): <rule_id_1>, ...
```

Group unresolved failures by `result_type` in `results_by_rule` and include grouped counts in the final summary (e.g., `still_failing_timeout: 2`, `still_failing_kantra_limitation: 1`).

If still_failing is non-empty, move on — don't block the pipeline.

### 5. Report

Collate pass/fail results from the test run and the fix loop. Generate `report.yaml` with per-rule test and verification status. No labels are written to rule YAML files — all pipeline metadata lives in the report.

```bash
go run ./cmd/report <log_flags> --source <comma-separated sources> --target <comma-separated targets> --output <migration_dir>/report.yaml --rules-total <N> --passed <P> --failed <F> --kantra-limitation <K> --passed-rules <comma-separated passed rule IDs> --failed-rules <comma-separated failed rule IDs> --kantra-limitation-rules <comma-separated kantra limitation rule IDs> --verified-rules <comma-separated verified rule IDs> --not-found-rules <comma-separated not-found rule IDs>
```

The `--verified-rules` and `--not-found-rules` flags come from the verification mapping built in step 2c (pattern_index → rule_id via construct's pattern_rule_map).

The report includes a `rules` section with per-rule `test_status` (passed/failed/kantra-limitation/untested) and `source_verified` (true/false). The pass rate is computed as `passed / (passed + failed)` — kantra limitations are excluded since they are not failures, but also not confirmed passes.

### 6. Summary

Print a formatted summary table using GitHub-flavored markdown:

```markdown
## Summary

| | |
|---|---|
| **Input** | <guide title or URL as a markdown link> |
| **Migration** | <primary_source> → <primary_target> (<language>) |
| **Guide** | <GUIDE_LINES> lines, <N> sections → <M> produced patterns, <K> skipped |
| **Rules** | <rules_count> generated, **<P>/<N> passed (<percent>%)** |
| **Verification** | <verified>/<total> source-verified, <not_found> not found, <skipped> skipped (omit row if all skipped) |
| **Kantra limitations** | <K> rules correct but not auto-testable — engine cannot compare non-semver versions (omit row if K=0) |
| **Fix iterations** | <iterations used, 0 if none> |
| **Timing** | total: <total elapsed> — ingest: <elapsed>, extract: <elapsed>, coverage: <elapsed>, test-gen: <elapsed>, validate: <elapsed>, report: <elapsed> |
| **Output** | `<migration_dir>/patterns.json` (patterns), `<migration_dir>/rules/` (rules), `<migration_dir>/tests/` (tests), `<migration_dir>/report.yaml` (report) |

### Rule Categories

Use the `groups` array from the `construct` JSON output — it lists each file and its rule count. Do not iterate rule files manually.

| Group | Rules | Status |
|---|---|---|
| <group_name> (<brief description of what rules cover>) | <rule_count> | <passed>/<total> passed |
| ... | ... | ... |
```

If there are failures, add a row to the top-level table:

```
| **Failed** | <rule_id_1>, <rule_id_2>, ... |
```

If coverage was low (< 30% of sections produced patterns), add a row:

```
| **Warning** | Low extraction coverage (<M>/<K> sections) |
```
